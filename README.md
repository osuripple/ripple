# Ripple [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marcostudios/ripple.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marcostudios/ripple)

This is the source code that powers [ripple](http://ripple.moe), a private/custom osu! server that has been in development for longer than I'd like to admit. (there's actually a longer history and commit log, but that's part of the shitty code).

Apart from the usual stuff you'll find even in the shittiest of custom/private bancho clones, Ripple has spectating, aaaaand _\*drumroll\*_ multiplayer!
